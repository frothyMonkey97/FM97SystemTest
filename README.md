# FM97SystemTest
This project is a series of tests for me to understand how git works

In actuality, it is my senior project for Bradley University. The SystemTest naming is so that random people don't try to take my project.

The project itself:

This projects goal is to create a cheap yet effective accident prediction system for motorcycles that includes a warning system for both
the rider and the driver behind. The accident prediction system will be for rear collitions only.
